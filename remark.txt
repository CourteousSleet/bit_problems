Using bitwise operators is very efficient,
because default operators such as /, * are
working for the complexity time of O(n^2),
% of O(n^3) and the bitwise operators are
working for just O(n), where n is the number
in binary representation.

Solutions which use bitmasking generally
take up exponential time and memory.
